{"name":"d3ploy","tagline":"Easily deploy to S3 with multiple environment support","body":"## Installation & Usage\r\n\r\nTo install, run `pip install d3ploy`.\r\nTo use, run `d3ploy`. Additional arguments may be specified. Run `d3ploy --help` for more information.\r\n\r\n## Authentication\r\n\r\nYour AWS credentials can be set in a number of ways:\r\n\r\n1. In a \".boto\" file in your home folder. See [Boto's documentation](http://docs.pythonboto.org/en/latest/boto_config_tut.html) for how to create this file.\r\n2. In a \".aws\" file in the folder you're running `d3ploy` in. Follows the same format as \".boto\".\r\n3. In the environment variables \"AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID\" and \"AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\".\r\n4. Passed in as arguments. `-a` or `--access-key` for the Access Key ID and `-s` or `--access-secret` for the Secret Access Key.\r\n5. In the per-enviroment configuration outlined below.\r\n\r\n## Configuration options\r\n\r\nWhen you run `d3ploy`, it will look in the current directory for a \"deploy.json\" file that defines the different deploy enviroments and their options. At a minimum, a \"default\" environment is required and is the environment used if you pass no arguments to `d3ploy`.\r\n\r\nYou can add as many environments as needed. Deploy to an environment by passing in its key like `d3ploy staging`.\r\n\r\nThe only required option for any environment is \"bucket\" for the S3 bucket to upload to. Additionally, you may define:\r\n\r\n* \"local_path\" to upload only the contents of a directory under the current one; defaults to \".\" (current directory)\r\n* \"bucket_path\" to upload to a subfolder in the bucket; defaults to \"/\" (root)\r\n* \"aws_key\" to specify the AWS Access Key ID to use for uploading\r\n* \"aws_secret\" to specify the AWS Secret Access Key to use for uploading\r\n* \"exclude\" to specify patterns to not upload\r\n\r\n## OS X Notification Center\r\n\r\nd3ploy will attempt to alert you via Notification Center when it is completed. To enable this feature, you need pyobjc; run `pip install pyobjc` to install.\r\n","google":"UA-3625251-12","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
